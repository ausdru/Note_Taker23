## Description:
For this challenge, I was challenged with creating a 'Note Taker' application that could be used to write and save notes. The app uses an Express.js backend and will save and retrieve user-generated note data from a JSON file. The application‚Äôs frontend has already been made, and it is now my responsibility to build the backend, connect them together, and lastly deploy my finished work to Heroku.
